"""Runtime settings — typed, frozen, fail-fast (the platform Settings pattern).

Concurrency knobs are the runtime's own business (ADR-0016: the runtime owns
its concurrency; the gateway owns routing and end-to-end deadlines). Slot
configuration becomes settings-driven when a second engine exists (M2 step 5);
until then the default slot is wired in ``main.build_manager``.
